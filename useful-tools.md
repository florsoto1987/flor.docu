## Visual Studio Code

<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">Link</a>

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.

As it supports markdown, you can easily open your documentation project folder and work on the files.

## Ubuntu Console for Windows

As a Technical Writer contributing to documentation with a Git based workflow, you will need a console to clone a repository to your computer, and then commit the changes back to the repository. While you can use the windows console, I find the Ubuntu console much more comfortable to use. However, it's a matter of personal choice. As you grow into your role, you will discover your own preferences.

## Snagit Editor

As a Technical Writer, you will find that taking screenshots and editing them is an intrinsic part of your work. This software will help you with that.

**This software has a trial version but you have to pay to continue using it.**

## Windows Snipping Tool

The Windows snipping tool is a PC screenshot tool that is included in Windows Vista and later by default. This is a free alternative to Snagit Editor. Open it by clicking **logo key + shift + S**.

If this key combination doesn't open the application, try clicking entering the name **Snipping Tool** in the search field located to the left of your toolbar.
