This is my first post here, and it's a test! I'm customizing the amazing <a href="https://beautifuljekyll.com/" target="_blank">Beautiful Jekyll</a> template by <a href="https://twitter.com/daattali" target="_blank">Dean Attali</a> to create an online portfolio for my documentation.

Find the links to the original project repo and social pages on the homepage of this documentation hub.

Bye for now!
